# What on Earth is this?
Well, it's a game (hopefully) that we [Shenanigans and also tomfoolery] are making about stealing soup. All of us have not much clue on what we're doing on the development side, so as you can tell it will be very surprising if we can pull it off. None of us have any clue on the art side mainly btw.
## I'm interested (somehow), where can I get this or what else is there about it?
Once we get a partialy working copy, we'll send previews here.
- Soup stealer is _*meant*_ to be a silly little game about stealing soup. However, it may or may not have a dark twist...
